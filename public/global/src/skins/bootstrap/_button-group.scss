// Checkbox and radio options
//
// In order to support the browser's form validation feedback, powered by the
// `required` attribute, we have to "hide" the inputs via `clip`. We cannot use
// `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` as that also hides the popover.
// Simply visually hiding the inputs via `opacity` would leave them clickable in
// certain cases which is prevented by using `clip` and `pointer-events`.
// This way, we ensure a DOM element is visible to position the popover from.
//
// See https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/12794 and
// https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/14559 for more information.
